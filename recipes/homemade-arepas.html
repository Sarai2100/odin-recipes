    <p><strong>Arepas are popular, Venezuelan cornmeal cakes that are a staple in Venezuelan cuisine. <br>
        Made from ground maize dough, these round, unleavened, and gluten-free cakes are grilled, baked, or fried to a golden, <br>
        crispy exterior with a soft, doughy interior. They are commonly split open and stuffed with diverse fillings like cheese, <br>
        shredded meat, beans, or avocado.</strong> <p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 mins. <strong>Cook Time:</strong> 20 mins. <strong>Total Time:</strong>  30 mins.  <strong>Servings:</strong> 8. <strong>Yield: </strong> 8 arepas.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li> 

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>

        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough.</li>
        <li>Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
